# Colliding Blocks
Simulating two colliding blocks inspired by Grant Sanderson (3Blue1Brown)

The idea of this project is to introduce some new features to the model and find out what happens.
Most of the ideas were also mentioned in the colloquium on the 17th of November at the University of Bonn.
These new features could be:
- gravitational interaction between blocks
- relativistic corrections
- friction
- more than two blocks
